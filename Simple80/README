This is a boot ROM CP/M for Simple 80

At boot time the CF is checked for a signature and autobooted if this is
present (for running things like Fuzix). If not then CP/M is entered.

The CF is mapped as drives A to D in the same fashion that most RC2014 and
Grant Searle derived systems do. E and F are mapped onto RAM and ROM drives
using the rest of the EPROM image and the other bank of RAM. The second
RAM bank is preserved as far as possible so *usually* it will survive a crash
and reset.

There is purposely no monitor or BASIC in the ROM as such, instead as CP/M
is booted from ROM your ROM image can provide both a BASIC and debugger
(MBASIC and DDT for example or R T Russell's rather nice BBC Basic for
CP/M which is not only nicer than the usual MBASIC but also 8K smaller
leaving you more ROM drive room).

The cpmtools definition for the ROM disc image is

diskdef s80rom
  seclen 128
  tracks 26
  sectrk 16
  blocksize 1024
  maxdir 32
  skew 0
  boottrk 0
  os 2.2
end

diskdef s80ram
  seclen 128
  tracks 31
  sectrk 16
  blocksize 1024
  maxdir 32
  skew 0
  boottrk 0
  os 2.2
end


and you can use that to assemble a cpm.raw which make will assemble into your
disk image if you are not using the Makefiles


Things to do

Move CP/M and the BIOS up as far as possible to get a bigger TPA
Spot 512K RAM and use a bigger RAMDISC
