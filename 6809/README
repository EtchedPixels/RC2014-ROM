CUBIX 6809
----------

This is a minor port of Dave Dunfield's CUBIX OS.

http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/d6809/cubix.htm

Known Bugs:
- The ROM test will incorrectly report a FAIL at this point. This is a cosmetic
  glitch that needs fixing.

Unsupported:
- Baud rate setting

Configuration:

The system is configured with two 4MB volumes that are laid out with 1MB
free then the two 4MB disk volumes. This allows for a PC style boot area
and partition table to be present (the CUBIX disk area can be protected
with a non-DOS partition from sector 2048 for 8MB)

Supported Hardware:

6809 CPU card with I/O at 0xFExx
16C550A Serial card at 0xC0 (optionally second port at 0xC8)
RC2014 512K/512K banked RAM/ROM card
IDE CF adapter at 0x10
Clock for the 6809 CPU
optionally an SC129 at 0x80 as a debug card during boot

The serial port is set to 38400 8N1. It prints a '*' very early in
initialization before anything that depends upon working RAM or other
devices.

Installation:

CUBIX itself runs from ROM and handles all the hardware setup. After running
a memory test it will initialize and display a '*' prompt. Hitting escape
will shortcut the memory test.

If you are creating a new CF disk rather than using the supplied image:
(supplied image will be available soon)

format a:
y
format b:
y

set default [system]
download asm.exe

(send asm.hex)

repeat for each of the binaries supplied in .hex format.



set default [main]

to get back to the normal working directory.


You can then download other files as desired, including Micro-C.

Using Cubix:

See the CUBIX manuals included in the downloads from 
http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/d6809/index.htm

Roughly speaking though

drive:[directory]pathname.ext

set default controls what is used if you omit the full pathname.

Everything has a directory and there is only one level of directory naming.

[system] is special and holds commands
[main] is where you start

Wilcards apply at both levels. So you can say

DIR A:[*]

to see everything on drive A.

DIR, COPY, DELETE, TYPE do exactly as you would expect including wildcards.
CHKDISK checks a disk for errors
ED is a visual editor. See the manual for more information. Hit F1 then type
EX and hit F1 again to save and exit.

A prorgrammers manual and source to the utilities and applications is included
in the full source distribution. These can be built under Cubix. A small number
of applications such as Micro-C, that still have a commercial form are supplied
binary only.

The system contains a fair set of languages, assembler and other development
tools and is basically self hosting.


Things Left To Do
-----------------
- Serial baud rate setting
- Floppy disk
- Possibly ACIA support
